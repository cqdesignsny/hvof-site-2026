# HVOF Site 2026

Modern marketing + lead-gen site for **Hudson Valley Office Furniture**. Next.js 16 rebuild that will replace the legacy WordPress site at [thewowguys.com](https://thewowguys.com) after sign-off.

**Live preview:** https://hvof-site-2026.vercel.app
**Admin (Floorplan):** https://hvof-site-2026.vercel.app/admin/login

## Pickup-from-anywhere

If you are a contributor (or AI agent) opening this repo for the first time, read **[`docs/HANDOFF.md`](./docs/HANDOFF.md)** before writing code. It has the full project state, design rules, and pending work.

If you have credentialed access (the Cesar/CQ Marketing flow), there is a private `CLAUDE.md` in the parent Dropbox folder that holds SSH credentials, the admin password, and other secrets. It is not in this repo on purpose.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Pull latest env from Vercel (Marketplace integrations included):

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=production --yes
```

Node 22+, pnpm 10+. Repository auto-deploys to Vercel on push to `main`.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16.2 App Router (Turbopack) |
| UI | shadcn/ui (Radix base) + Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Animation | `motion/react` |
| State (cart) | Zustand + localStorage persist |
| Type | Inter Tight (display) / Inter (body) / JetBrains Mono via `next/font/google` |
| Forms | Native React, posts to `/api/lead` and `/api/quote`, Resend transactional email |
| Lead store | Neon Postgres (HVOF-DB) via `@neondatabase/serverless`. In-memory fallback for local dev. |
| Admin | `/admin` (Floorplan), HMAC cookie auth, light/dark theme |
| Analytics | GA4 + Meta Pixel via `@next/third-parties` (env-gated) |
| Reporting data plane | **CQ Signal** (separate Next.js app) via REST. Floorplan reads `/api/v1/businesses/hudson-valley-office-furniture/{snapshot,brief,recommendations}` and renders in HVOF tokens. Mock fallback while the Signal contract is being shipped. |
| Hosting | Vercel (Fluid Compute) |
| Image CDN | thewowguys.com WP CDN + AIS Inc image library + local `/public/products/` |

`src/components/admin/report/` holds the report UI primitives (DeltaPill, TrendChart, ChannelDonut, MetricTile, SectionCard, RangeTabs, StatusPill, RecommendationsList, BriefMarkdown, MockBanner). All hand-rolled SVG, no chart library, in HVOF tokens.

## Brand tokens

In `src/app/globals.css`. **Do not introduce other yellows or fonts.**

- `--brand-yellow` `#E7C81F` (locked)
- `--brand-yellow-hover` `#d4b71c`
- `--brand-ink` `#000000`, `--brand-paper` `#fff`, `--brand-cream` `#f5f5f5` (Trusted-By bar)
- Display Inter Tight, Body Inter, Mono JetBrains Mono
- Base font-size 18px, 18.5px at xl+
- All h1/h2/h3 use `font-semibold` everywhere

## Design rules (non-negotiable)

1. **No em-dashes anywhere.** Replace with periods or commas.
2. **No emojis.** Use the webp icons in `/public/icons/` and SVG brand icons in `components/site/social-icons.tsx`.
3. **No numbered prefixes on cards** (no `01`, `02`, etc.). No slide counters. No fake bios on team cards.
4. **One yellow only:** `#E7C81F`.
5. **Header is solid black** with a full-color logo always (now 26% larger).
6. **Big-headline closer CTAs use `<ScrollText />`** with the snap-to-center pin.
7. **Card hover:** brand-yellow border at rest, ring + lift on hover (`.card-interactive` utility).
8. **Get a Quote button hover**: white background, BLACK text. Do not let it go dark on the black header.
9. **Product card images**: square + object-contain on white, padded, no zoom on hover.
10. **Trusted-By bar**: cream background, grayscale logos.

## Quote cart vs Quote Request

- **`/quote-request`** is the multi-step lead form (yellow theme, numbered indicators, project info first → contact LAST). Replaces Typeform JLIMOo51. Posts to `/api/lead` with `formType: "main-lead"`.
- **`/quote`** is the product cart. Add chairs and showcase items via `<AddToQuoteButton />`. Zustand store at `src/lib/quote-cart.ts`, localStorage key `hvof-quote-cart`. Floating yellow indicator. Submits to `/api/quote`.
- **`/contact`** is a simple traditional contact form for general inquiries.
- Showcase products (no price) link to `/quote-request?product=<sku>` via the **Inquire** button on their card.

No Stripe, no checkout. Payment offline after the quote is finalized.

## Lead persistence (Neon Postgres)

Provisioned via Vercel Marketplace as **HVOF-DB**. `src/lib/leads-store.ts` reads/writes Postgres via `DATABASE_URL` when set, falls back to a globalThis-pinned in-memory store otherwise. Schema (single `leads` table with id/received_at/form_type + jsonb payload) is created lazily on first call.

`/api/lead` calls `recordLead()` after the Resend email. Floorplan dashboard reads from the same store.

The Neon integration is currently attached to Production + Preview only. Local `pnpm dev` falls back to in-memory until you also attach to Development from the Vercel Storage tab.

## Floorplan admin

The HVOF backend.

- Brand: "Floorplan" (mirrors TZ Electric's "Switchboard").
- Auth: HMAC-signed cookie via `lib/admin-auth.ts`. Single shared `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var. 7-day session.
- Theme: light/dark toggle, `localStorage` persist, inline init script prevents flash.
- Pages: Dashboard, Leads, Knowledge Base, Agents, Plan, Reports.

To rotate the admin password:

```bash
vercel env update ADMIN_PASSWORD <env> --yes
# paste new value (use printf, not echo, to avoid trailing newline)
vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

## Deployment

```bash
# Pushing to main auto-deploys to Vercel
git push

# Force a deploy from local
vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

The Vercel project is on the `cq-marketings-projects` scope. Future plan: transfer to a dedicated HVOF team via the Vercel dashboard once the `hvofmarketing@gmail.com` account is set up.

## Important Next.js 16 notes

This is **not the Next.js you know.** Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/` before writing routing or data-fetching code. The `AGENTS.md` at the repo root enforces this for AI agents.

Key changes from 15:
- `params` is a `Promise` in dynamic routes: `const { sku } = await params`.
- Public routes live under `/app/(public)/` route group (refactored 2026-05-08 so admin gets its own clean shell).
- shadcn defaults to Base UI now; this repo was re-init'd to Radix base. Don't switch back.
- `async headers()` in `next.config.ts` is correct for response-header config. The Vercel plugin's validator complains; that's a false positive.

## What's done, what's pending

See [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](./docs/HANDOFF.md) for the full state.

Highlights:

- ✓ ~44 unique public routes deployed (12 city pages, 8 county pages, Hudson Valley region, all 9 furniture categories, dynamic product details, gallery, e-catalog, showroom, virtual tour, contact, quote, giveaway, NYS contracts, quote-request)
- ✓ 50+ products across the catalog (13 priced chairs + 36+ showcase items)
- ✓ All 41 NYS Contract manufacturers wired with outbound links
- ✓ Multi-step Quote Request form replacing Typeform JLIMOo51
- ✓ Floorplan admin with login, dashboard, leads pipeline, KB/agents/plan/reports stubs, light/dark toggle
- ✓ Neon Postgres lead pipeline (HVOF-DB, durable in production)
- ✓ Service-areas section on home, county pages link to city pages
- ✓ Giveaway page in nav + footer with the actual Q2 2026 desk photo
- ✓ OG share card + branded favicon + Apple icon (logo on black)
- ✓ Trusted By marquee with 11 partner logos (cream + grayscale + larger)
- ✓ Mobile horizontal overflow fixed
- ✓ Get a Quote button hover legibility fixed (white bg, black text)
- ✓ Agent Training questionnaire (`/admin/training`, 13 sections, markdown email packet)
- ✓ CQ Signal data-plane consumer wired: types, mock, fetch client, `/admin/reports` page in HVOF tokens, env-gated lead-ingest webhook from `/api/lead`. Mock until `SIGNAL_API_BASE` is set.

Pending (priority order):

- Live Signal credentials: paste `SIGNAL_API_BASE` and `SIGNAL_API_KEY` once the Signal-side session ships v1 REST (see `SIGNAL-HANDOFF.md` in the Dropbox project root)
- Sell Your Furniture form + own /sell-your-furniture page (Typeform JAHzhOUt)
- Native giveaway entry form on /giveaway (Typeform e5SrmqW1)
- Weekly leads digest via Vercel Cron + Resend (now feasible with persistence)
- Knowledge base content authoring + display
- Concierge web-chat agent
- More product photos pulled into Desks / Conference / Healthcare categories
- Service pages (/services/space-planning, /installation, /delivery)
- Real WooCommerce-style descriptions for chairs
- Marshall + Sterling case study at /gallery/marshall-sterling
- DNS cutover, Google Business Profile, Search Console sitemap
- Meta Pixel ID
- GA Analytics MCP unblock (org policy issue documented in private CLAUDE.md)
- Rotate ADMIN_PASSWORD off the dev placeholder

## Notes

- The Dropbox folder marks `node_modules/` and `.next/` as ignored via `xattr com.dropbox.ignored 1` so they don't churn through sync. Re-apply after a fresh clone.
- See `AGENTS.md` for AI-agent instructions.
- For credentials and the full handoff including SSH password and admin credentials, see the parent Dropbox folder's `CLAUDE.md` (not in git).
